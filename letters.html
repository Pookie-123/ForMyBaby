    <div class="poem-body">
I still remember that Gwalior day,  
I looked down from my room, and there you lay.  
Not inside anything called a bed, not asleep, just out on the street,  
Nervous standing there, so so sweet.  

You glanced up, and I swear I froze.  
That smile, that face, that perfect pose.  
My heart said, "There he is... the one,"  
And in that moment, love had begun.  

You looked so cute that I swear I just stared;  
Without wasting time, I came down... my soul scared.  
That world turned light the moment I saw you,  
As if every wrong had just gone right.

    <div class="poem-title">The Light We Loved</div>
    <div class="poem-body">
In our small Jaipur Airbnb room  
The astronaut lamp would gently bloom  
Its golden glow so soft and bright  
Wrapped us both in quiet light  

Outside the world would rush and race  
But inside time would slow its pace  
Just you and me in that soft hue  
A moment still just made for two  

We didn’t talk, we didn’t need  
Your eyes said all my heart could read  
You looked at me and in your gaze  
I saw love in a hundred ways  

Now when I miss your hand in mine  
I turn it on and let it shine  
Not just a lamp, not just the night  
But you and me and that little light
