I still remember that Gwalior day,
I looked down from my room, and there you lay.
Not inside anything called a bed, not asleep,just out on the street,
Nervous standing there, so so sweet.

You glanced up, and I swear I froze.
That smile, that face, that perfect pose.
My heart said, "There he is...the one,"
And in that moment, love had begun.

You looked so cute that I swear I just stared;
Without wasting time, I came down...my soul scared.
That world turned light the moment I saw you,
As if every wrong had just gone right.

Your voice soft like my favourite song,
Familiar, safe as if you had always been there.
I didn’t need fireworks, I didn’t need some sign,
Because the way you were... felt already mine.

And then those rides, your scooter, just the two of us 
The wind in your hair, the sky so blue.
Me at the back, holding on tight,
Thinking, "God, I could do this every day and night."

You’d turn around, give me a cheeky grin,
And I’d fall again..no shame about it, no denial.
I saw your hair dance in the air;
I whispered, "Please let this moment just freeze."

Then came Jaipur  and oh, those days.
Our little escape, in so many ways.
Holding hands in a brand new place,
Still feeling like home in your arms, your face.

We laughed, cuddled, kissed until the wee hours.
Hugging secretly as if it were destined.
From walks in the market to silent rooms,
You lit up every space with your blooms.

And that night when you gave your chain to me,
Gave it to me....soft, so right.
I wear it close to my chest,
It's more than just gold...it's a place where you reside.

I touch it whenever I miss your face,
Whenever I wish for your arms, your warm embrace.
Because irrespective of distance,
You live within me day by-day.

Back in Mumbai, the bed is so cold,
No arms to hold me, no hands to hold.
But I close my eyes, and still, you are there;
Your voice fills my mind, calm and clear.

I miss your cuddles, your kisses too,
The way you’d whisper, “I love you.”
The way you’d smile when you pulled me close,
Like I was someone you truly chose.

I miss the way you look at me,
Like I’m the only boy you see.
I miss your hair, your skin, your touch 
God, baby, I miss you so damn much.

Neil my babyy :), you’re not just a piece of my heart,
You’re the whole thing, you’ve been from the start.
Even this distance can’t make us fade,
Because real love? That never gets swayed.

So till we meet and I hold you tight,
And kiss you again under soft moonlight,
Just know this truth,it’s forever true:
There’s no one else, it’s always you. ❤️

In our small Jaipur Airbnb room  
The astronaut lamp would gently bloom  
Its golden glow so soft and bright  
Wrapped us both in quiet light  

Outside the world would rush and race  
But inside time would slow its pace  
Just you and me in that soft hue  
A moment still just made for two  

We didn’t talk we didn’t need  
Your eyes said all my heart could read  
You looked at me and in your gaze  
I saw love in a hundred ways  

Now when I miss your hand in mine  
I turn it on and let it shine  
Not just a lamp not just the night  
But you and me and that little light
